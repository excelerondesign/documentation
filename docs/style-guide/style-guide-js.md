1. All comments must be multiline `/* ... */`
2. Componentize as much as possible.
    - For example: A form has steps that use an accordion like style. The form will be on multiple pages. This code should be self reliant and used as a component.
3. Code that will be used on every single page will be included in `index.js`
    - Other code that is page specific should be a single resource
